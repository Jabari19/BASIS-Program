        <h2>Module 1: Journal Entry</h2>
        <p>Cloud Computing relates to me and because of my course am doing. I want to understand more so that when I am done with BASIS Programme and luckily get a job, I would be able to use this research knowledge and apply it. There are so many things involved in cloud computing which make it more appealing for instances scalability, the cost involved, accessibility and innovation and also reliability. This combination that has attracted big organization to use it and grow their business is what amazes me. I will use the 7 pillars of literacy to in my research where I will involve surveys and interviews to get more info.

            Blogs and online communities have been my biggest help on my research, Academic journals also have been of big help.
            
            Now, in cloud computing is the computer services one get through the internet which is very cost efficiency, accessible, without owning any physical infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>Exploring the Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing?</h3>
            <p>I have completed some courses that cover cloud computing and i feel like i can use my knowledge, online/internet to help me work on my research. For example, Today am going to talk about things i have learnt to make or keep our information safe in CLoud Computing. Security is like a big shield to protect us from unauthorized acces by bad people. Encryption and authentication are some of the way to  us safe. It is not only Cloud Computing companies, but it is team work to keep things secure. Privacy is very important because keepingo ur information private so that noone cn access them without our permission.Using things like CCPA (or California Consumer Privacy Act). I used this  to get some information
               <a href ="https://www.academia.edu/40733822/CLOUD_COMPUTING_Cloud_Computing_Overview?sm=b">Click on this link </a> Using my topic Cloud Computing helps me to narrow down most of my area of discussion and the resources to use. The 3 things that i know about my Security and privacy are:-
                <ol>
                    <li>  Shared Responsibility - Security and privacy in cloud computing is a team effort between the service provider and the customer</li>
                    <li>  Privacy-Enhancing Technologies - Variuos technology to enhance privacy is used to proctect our data and infortion. Encrption and authentication are some of them.</li>
                    <li>  Regulatory Compliance - Using CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), is very crucialso that we can maintain our data in the cloud. </li>
                </ol>
                  Questions that arise specifically when talking about security, but on my own the question that arise are time management, where to find resources and technology issues for example what is my computer crash, will i finish my research?
                   <ol>
                    <li>is the user awareness and the level of education both the user and organization aware of the security implications when using cloud computing services? What actions are taken to educate the users on the best practice?</li>
                    <li>Another question is ethecal considerations associated witn the data collection,storage and processing in the cloud specifically when it comes to sensitive or personal information? But in Security and Privacy of cloud computing , this is what arises. </li>
                    <li>Also, What are the legal/regulatory issues?</li>
                </ol></p>

            <h2>Module 3 Journal Entry</h2>
            <p>I have been fascinated by cloud services lately, especially as we've been discussing cloud migration in our homework. This has led me to ponder why cloud computing is so prevalent, what its benefits are, and why both individuals and businesses are increasingly opting for cloud services. SOme of the advantages cloud services offers are: scalability, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and enhanced collaboration. Many individuals and businesses are migrating to the cloud to leverage these benefits and streamline their operations. Though there are many thins a dont understand which i will use the library and any academic materials to learn and get the understanding.- </p>

        <h2>Module 1: Progress Report</h2>
        <p>I've decided to focus my research on Cloud Computing, covering important aspects like what it is, its costs, security, and the software involved. Cloud Computing can be complicated, especially with the rise of AI. I anticipate facing challenges in fully understanding how it all works. To overcome this, I'll dedicate time to thorough research and seek guidance from my professors. Additionally, I'll leverage AI and utilize the library to gather information.

            My next step is to use the 7 pillars of information literacy to help me navigate through my research journey. These pillars will serve as a guide to ensure I gather relevant and credible information effectively.</p>

            <div class="report">
                <h2>Module 2: Progress Report</h2>
                <p>Going through my topic of research <b>Cloud  Computing</b>, this is what i have prepared to work on:-
    
                    <ol>
                        <li>  I will use the Libray, my fellow classmates and my Professor as my resource</li>
                        <li>  I have developed my research startegy whereby i will allocate my time evenly in every topic i will cover specifically for my research</li>
                        <li>  I will gather the information i need before isatrt sampling</li>
                        <li>  I will make sure my research is thoroughly evaluated before making infprmed decisions</li>
                        <li>  Make sure the research am working on is thoroughly reviewd, organized, prodiced and completed successfully</li>
                        <li> AFter i finish my research i will be able to share a well organized, and thoroughly researched information to my classmates. </li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>This week was very productive because my group helped me to understand fully about my topic of research. Things they were able to clarify and make me understand is how to go about getting resources for refernces toward my reaserch.  Another thing was time management where i need to set aside time to evenly tackle each section and get more information for my research. Also was about using technology to record or store my work. Now, since i identified,defined my research topic, i going in fully swing to start getting my resources for my research project</p>

                <h2>Module 3: Progress Report</h2>
                <p>I have come up with a structured approach on how to do my research goals and this was due to the Librarian info that she provided on how to access information using the library website. I tried to fomulate some quiz on my research that have not been addresed properly in the field. My next research methodology i am planning to use will be case studies, theorical analysis. I will also involve peer review to help improve the quality of my research topic.</p>
                      
            </div>
            <h2>Module 4 Progress Report</h2>
            <p>My research journey is progressing really good. I have writen down a draft of my outline on how my project will look like, i am trying to understand the  plagiarism fair share or copy cat so that i dont use them in my research. Time management has been my issues because i have not visited the library and get the information i had requested from the librarian. I think i should get myself together and manage my time well so that idnt lag behind.  </p>

        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>I'm going to talk about Cloud Computing and how it's changed the way organizations work. Lots of businesses and people want to make their computer systems safer and more efficient. So, what is Cloud Computing? It's when you use the internet to access services like storing data, running programs, and using servers. It's like renting computer stuff online instead of buying and managing it yourself.</p>

        <h2>Module 1: Lab Activity-Week 2</h2>
        <p>The reason why i chose cloud computing is the benefits it offers to individuals and business. For example, it is cost effective, very flexible, good for storing large amount of data, and also  very reliable when it comes to application hosting. Looking on those options it makes it a number one choice for many organizations. Thee questions that arised from the group was like, acceptance-Many people dont accept change that quick because most of them dont understand technology and the only solution for that is to keep on educating then about the tecnology. Another quetion is how will virtualization technology work with cloud computing?, Another question was about other cloud computing providers and their charges?. The discussion really helped me to add more benefits to my cloud computing research. Security, innovation, reliability, accessibility, cost and the scalality are some of the points my group discussed and am going to expound on them so that i can come up with a good report. </p>
        <h2>Module 3 Lab Activity</h2>
        <p>We discussed each individual research topic and we agreed on a strategy to conduct a peer-to-peer reviews on our respective research projects to enhance them. Additionally, we agreed to collaborate closely with the librarians to support and guide our research activities.</p>
